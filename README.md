# LogNormalMixture Model

This project implements the LogNormalMixture model for option pricing, based on the paper "Lognormal-mixture dynamics and calibration to market volatility smiles" by Damiano Brigo, Fabio Mercurio, and Francesco Rapisarda. The model and methods are encapsulated in a Python class and are used to calculate implied volatilities and option prices.
